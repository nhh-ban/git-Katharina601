#We can see in the diagram that there are more small galaxies than larger ones.
#Therefore, we can reject the signs that the smaller objects are underresented
#in the sample. 

#Explanation: The universe is still largely unexplored. In general, galaxies
#have an almost unimaginable gigantic size for humans. Most galaxies that are
#discovered are rather of the smaller kind and only a few are larger. 
#In the universe there are smaller structures formed first and these have then
#merged to form larger structures. 
#Therefore, there tend to be more smaller galaxies because they were formed 
#earlier in the history of the universe.
